## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I tried updating the settings page but ran into errors, so I tried heading back and reloading the old GitHub file. However, my original github file wasn't uploaded correctly. Thus, I had to start over. However, I was able to update the UI into a new format while I started over.
